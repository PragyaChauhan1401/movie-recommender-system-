# 🎬 Movie Recommender System
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System project!
This application suggests movies based on user preferences using machine learning techniques and a simple, interactive web interface.

📌 Project Overview
The Movie Recommender System is built using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods. It leverages Python libraries for data processing and machine learning and uses Streamlit to create a user-friendly web application for personalized recommendations.

 🚀 Features
- Personalized movie recommendations
- Search for movies based on user input
- Real-time predictions via a web interface
- Lightweight and easy to deploy
- Deployed on Render (or any cloud platform)

🛠️ Tech Stack
  Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
  Pandas  
  NumPy  
  Scikit-learn  
  NLTK   
  Web App Framework: Streamlit  
  Deployment: Render (or your chosen cloud service)

🧠 How It Works
# Data Preprocessing:

  1. Cleaning and transforming the movie dataset.
  
  2. Creating feature vectors for movies.

# Recommendation Engine:
  
  1. Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies similar to the one user likes based on movie metadata.
  
  2. Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on user behavior and similarities between users.

# Web Application:
  
  1. User selects or searches for a movie.
  
  2. Top similar movies are displayed instantly.

🏃‍♀️ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required libraries:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

Running the Application
```streamlit run app.py```
The app will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501/.

Deployment (Optional)
You can deploy the app using Render:

🎯 Future Improvements
  1.Add user login for personalized experiences
  
  2.Include user ratings for better collaborative filtering
  
  3.Deploy a scalable backend (e.g., FastAPI + Streamlit frontend)
  
  4.Add trending/movie posters using TMDb API
